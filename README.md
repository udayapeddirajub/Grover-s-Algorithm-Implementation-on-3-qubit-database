# Grover-s-Algorithm-Implementation-on-3-qubit-database
I have implemented the Grover's algorithm N=8 as database size and the example results are attached. Most of the resources on internet like Qiskit text book constructed the circuit which is applicable to a particular target state only, like if you go to Qiskit textbook you can see the target state for two qubit circuit is taken as \(|11>\) and they hard coded the reflection operator and diffusion operator to work with this particular input target state only. So what if you want to apply Grover's algorithm to find the target state \(|00>\) or some other, I have Implemented the Grover's algorithm by considering all the possible case i.e,. you can query any random state you wish to search from the database.
